## Project: Exploratory Data Analysis with R
EDA of a White Wine Quality dataset with 4898 white wines and 11 variables on quantifying the chemical properties of each wine.

### Summary
- Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
- Quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
- Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
- visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

### Data
