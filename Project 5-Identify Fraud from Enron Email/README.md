## Project: Identify Fraud from Enron Email
building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset

### Summary
- Create, select and transform features
- Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
- Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance

### Data
[Enron Email Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/) - This dataset was collected and prepared by the CALO Project (A Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes). It contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, organized into folders. The corpus contains a total of about 0.5M messages. 

### Code
- `Enron_ml.py`: main machine learning code for this project 
- [mini-projects](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git): mini projects source code when learning basic machine learning concepts through this dataset

### Requirement

This project requires Python 2.7
